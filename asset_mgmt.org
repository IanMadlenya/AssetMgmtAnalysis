* Asset pricing - consumption based model

** Basic assumption 

- people are *expected utility maximizers*: with future cash flows $X$
  and utility function $U$, the optimization problem is

$$\underset{\xi}{\max}\ \mathbb{E}[U(X(\xi))]$$


- people are *risk-averse*: utility $U$ increases with money ($U'>0$),
  but marginal utility of money decreases ($U''<0$)

** Concave utility
- due to concavity, uncertainty in future cash flows negatively
  affects expected utility

   \begin{itemize}
   \item[$\Rightarrow$] for given expectation, cash flow distributions with 
     lower volatility are preferred

** Basic assumption notes                                             :notes:

- builds on Cochrane's consumption based model

- any additional euro to profits is worth less utility than any
  additional lost euro -> better formulation

   \begin{itemize}
   \item<+-> assets: prices, dividends
     \begin{itemize}
     \item[$\Rightarrow$]<+-> if unique component: higher asset
       volatility needs to be compensated through higher expected returns
     \end{itemize}

** Consequences for cash flow components

If future cash flow is completely determined through assets:

** Cash flow components

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
   Components of future cash flows:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item<+-> assets: prices, dividends
     \begin{itemize}
     \item[$\Rightarrow$] if unique component: higher asset
       volatility needs to be compensated through higher expected returns
       (\alert{Markowitz})
     \item[$\Rightarrow$]<+-> \alert{too simplistic}: asset cash flows
       are not the only determinant of your future cash flows
     \end{itemize}
   \item<+-> job income 
   \item<+-> losses due to catastrophic events
   \item[$\Rightarrow$]<+-> utility is derived from \alert{overall} cash
     flow distribution
   \item[$\Rightarrow$]<.->uncertainty in \alert{overall} cash flow
     distribution should be minimized: smoothing over all components
   \end{itemize}

** Notes                                                              :notes:
CAPM could already be derived without additional components
- minimizing correlation 
- everybody invests in correlation minimizing portfolios 
- idiosyncratic risks get diversified away
- affecting prices and hence returns: compensation for systemic risk
  only 

** Example: choose your preferred asset

Idea:
- smooth future cash flows over all components
- assets should be valuable when you need them

Examples:
- job loss should be smoothed through asset prices 
  -> job loss during recession
  -> favorable if asset prices are high during recessions

Which asset do you value more?


** Conclusion
You want assets that are valuable at the time that you need them! 

"When" could mean:
- a given point in time -> evolution up to this event does not matter
  (10 year bond)
- a given state of nature -> need to sell asset only when I lose job 

** Examples

- house near river -> no stocks of insurance companies
- job loss
  - no stocks that follow the market
  - no stocks of the company you are working at
- going back to Pakistan -> exchange risk
- oil industry? 
- single asset with high idiosyncratic risk -> you want to get
  compensated for risk (if you are the only one at the market?)

** Risks
- risks that you have and everybody else -> they give higher expected
  returns to compensate you
- risks that only you have -> avoid assets that are correlated with
  them 
- risks that everybody else has, but you don't

** Consequences
- you have to think first in which circumstances you need money
- if you have different concerns than the market, you could get higher
  expected returns that translate into comparatively even higher
  utility 
- allegedly, some common risk factors could be identified: Fama /
  French 

** Fama French
Where is volatility compensation??


** Forecasting returns
- allegedly, according to Cochrane, future annual returns could be
  forecast through dividend price ratios 
- consequences for higher frequency returns?
  - simple shift of means is not sufficient!

* Markowitz

** Overconfidence
expert vs statistical overconfidence

** Problems with utility
- volatility is only one way to measure uncertainty -> skewness,
  worst-case, ...
- problems with utility theory: inconsistent for small stakes / large
  stakes bets 
- how does Markowitz work with / relate to asset pricing?
  - for risks that everybody else has but you don't, Markowitz will
    correctly find a good mean-vola ratio and invests into them
  - for risks that only you have, Markowitz does not notice that
    prevailing risk-return ratio is not sufficient to compensate you
    for it
  - risks that everybody has: 
    - usually picked due to better risk-return ratio
    - but: high correlation to other assets could make good
      risk-return ratio undesired
- asset pricing could generate improved moment estimation?
