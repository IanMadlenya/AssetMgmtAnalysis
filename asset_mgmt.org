* Asset pricing - consumption based model

** Basic assumption 

- people are *expected utility maximizers*: with future wealth $X$ and
  utility function $U$, the optimization problem is

$$\underset{\xi}{\max}\ \mathbb{E}[U(X(\xi))]$$


- people are *risk-averse*: utility $U$ increases with money ($U'>0$),
  but marginal utility of money decreases ($U''<0$)

** Concave utility
- due to concavity, uncertainty inherent to future wealth negatively
  affects expected utility

- builds on Cochrane's consumption based model

- any additional euro to profits is worth less utility than any
  additional lost euro -> better formulation

   Components of future wealth:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item<+-> assets: prices, dividends
     \begin{itemize}
     \item[$\Rightarrow$] if assets are unique component: higher asset
       volatility needs to be compensated through higher expected returns
       (\alert{Markowitz})
     \item[$\Rightarrow$]<+-> \alert{too simplistic}: asset cash flows
       are not the only determinant of your future wealth
     \end{itemize}
   \item<+-> job income 
   \item<+-> losses due to catastrophic events
   \item[$\Rightarrow$]<+-> utility is derived from \alert{overall} cash
     flow distribution
   \item[$\Rightarrow$]<.->volatility of \alert{overall} wealth
     distribution should be diversified away: smoothing over all components

** Notes                                                              :notes:
CAPM could already be derived without additional components
- minimizing correlation 
- everybody invests in correlation minimizing portfolios 
- idiosyncratic risks get diversified away
- affecting prices and hence returns: compensation for systemic risk
  only 

** Examples: choose your preferred asset
Given two assets *A* and *B* with *identical* return distributions
($F_{A}\sim F_{B}$), which one would you prefer?

- You are working for Microsoft. Stock A is of Microsoft, while
  stock B is of Walmart.

- You have property within an earthquake zone. Stock A is of Walmart,
  stock B is of a large reinsurance company.

*** Basic investment rule
Given equal payoff distributions, you should prefer assets that are
valuable when you need them. 

In other words: demand compensation
Otherwise: 


** Explanation of when                                                :notes:
Idea:
- smooth future wealth over all components
- assets should be valuable when you need them

"When" could mean:
- a given point in time -> evolution up to this event does not matter
  (10 year bond)
- a given state of nature -> need to sell asset only when I lose job 


** Explanation of CAPM
Examples:
- job loss should be smoothed through asset prices 
  -> job loss during recession
  -> favorable if asset prices are high during recessions

What about betas? Why is idiosyncratic risk not compensated? Would you
want to get compensated for it?
- single asset with high idiosyncratic risk -> you want to get
  compensated for risk (if you are the only one at the market?)

** Risks
- risks that you have and everybody else -> they give higher expected
  returns to compensate you!
- risks that only you have -> avoid assets that are correlated with
  them!
- risks that everybody else has, but you don't: investment
  opportunity! 

** Consequences
- you have to think first in which circumstances you need money
- if you have different concerns than the market, you could get higher
  expected returns that translate into comparatively even higher
  utility 
- allegedly, some common risk factors could be identified: Fama /
  French 

** Fama French
Where is volatility compensation??


** Forecasting returns
- allegedly, according to Cochrane, future annual returns could be
  forecast through dividend price ratios 
- consequences for higher frequency returns?
  - simple shift of means is not sufficient!

* Markowitz

** Overconfidence
expert vs statistical overconfidence

** Problems with utility
- volatility is only one way to measure uncertainty -> skewness,
  worst-case, ...
- problems with utility theory: inconsistent for small stakes / large
  stakes bets 
- how does Markowitz work with / relate to asset pricing?
  - for risks that everybody else has but you don't, Markowitz will
    correctly find a good mean-vola ratio and invests into them
  - for risks that only you have, Markowitz does not notice that
    prevailing risk-return ratio is not sufficient to compensate you
    for it
  - risks that everybody has: 
    - usually picked due to better risk-return ratio
    - but: high correlation to other assets could make good
      risk-return ratio undesired
- asset pricing could generate improved moment estimation?
